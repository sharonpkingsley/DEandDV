# DEandDV
An R package to calculate differentially expressed and differentially variable of genes while statistically correcting for dropouts.

This package introduces a method for conducting DE and DV analysis while alleviating the effect of dropouts. It is developed with a focus on speed an scalability to address the issue of progressively larger volumes of data being produced in scRNA sequencing
